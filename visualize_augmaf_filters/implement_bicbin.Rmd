## This document is derived from the algorithm described in 
**"Biclustering Sparse Binary Genomic Data" (Uitert et al)**
*The Journal of Computational Biology, Vol 15, Number 10, 2008*

### The algorithm relies on a scoring function, defined here:
```{r}
score_C <- function(sub_d_m, sub_d_n,d_sum,p) { #d_orig is subsampled matrix, d_sum is sum from submatrix of collapsed sums, p is average proportion of ones
  dimprod=sub_d_m*sub_d_n*p #Expected ones in this submatrix?
  k=d_sum #How many ones actually in this submatrix?
  #Calculate score
  if((k >= dimprod) & (k <= (2*dimprod))) {
    return ((k-dimprod)^2)/(3*(sub_d_m+1)*(sub_d_n+1)*p)
  } else {
    if(k > (2*dimprod)){
      return ((k-dimprod)^2)/(sub_d_m*sub_d_n*(k + dimprod))
    } else{
      return (0) #Only defined for k >= mnp?
    }
  }
}
```
```
-This function assumes an average proportion of 1's in the large matrix and uses the expected number of ones based on the subsampled matrix size to calculate a 'concentration score' for the subsampled matrix. 
-Note that a significant elevation in score is expected when the subsampled matrix has a concentration that is twice more than that expected
```
